## This project was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, where I included three points of interaction made with Javascript


<br>

- I created a ligth mode that allow users to change all the UI from dark colors to white, in order to activate light mode I made a switch button in the upper left corner of the page that mantains always visible so the user is not required to go to the beginning of the page to activate light mode.

- The second JavaScript Intercaction is a gallery in my projects area that allows the user switch between images of my different projects, when the user clicks in one project, the title, a short description and the link is displayed above the project.

- The third and last interaction with JavaScript activates when the user uses the contact form located in the third page of my portfolio, once the user clicks in the 'submit' button, a message is displayed in the same area where the input boxes were located.

# I started this project creating a wireframe that would help me to accomodate each element faster <br>

# The Final Result
## After applying HTML, CSS and JavaScript I tried to mantain the same format, resulting in this:

## Unsolved Problems:

- When the page is set to mobile, a part of the navigation bar is not inside the limits of the page.
